This is my attempt as making any unix/linux machine I'm on feel like home.

The files include a ton of good configuration for zsh, git, vim, and others.

The setup.sh script will link all of the files in my repo to your home directory, but will fail if you have any files/directories of the same name.

The setup.bat script will set everything up on windows using mklink (assuming C:\ is where your home directory is)

vim plugins included:
    command-t
    minibufexpl
    mru
    nerdcommenter
    nerdtree
    showmarks
    snipmate
    supertab
    taglist
    vim-colors-solarized
    conque
    fugitive
    vim-git
    surround
    yankring
    pathogen (not a git submodule)
